## Test Instructions
At this time, the app can only be manually evaluated. The expected functionality is that the user is directed to a main html.homepage with a button  that indicates "Get Started". When the user clicks the button they are redirected to  the note entry page. THe note entry page will maintain a left section that populates with notes entered by users in the not entry field to the right. Notes require a title and note texts. Upon entry of the note title and text the 'clear form' button and 'save note' buttons will appear. When a user clicks the 'clear form' button, the note title and text enered will be eliminated. When a user clicks the 'Save note' button the note will be rendered in the left section. Notes rendered in the left sections will maintain a trash can icon in red. When a user clicks the trash can icon the note associated with that icon will be permanently deleted.
